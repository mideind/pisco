1. If your computer is slow, becoming impatient won't make it any faster.
Don't click anything too fast or try to refresh the page. This will just confuse the computer and it will run even slower. The best thing to do is just let the page or window load.

2. The more documents you delete, the more space you will have on the computer.
Having more space on your computer can allow everything to run faster. Clear your recycle bin every once in a while to delete unnecessary files.

3. Opening up more than two or three web browser tabs will discombobulate your computer.
Clicking back and forth between several tabs can use up precious RAM and CPU power, and make loading websites take even longer.

4. If your computer crashes frequently, you could lose important data.
Save everything you work on several times. Everything! The last thing you want is to have your computer crash as you top off that 10-page essay.

5. If the internet is slow, wait until other people have logged off to get online.
Consider using the internet when everyone in your household is asleep, or essentially not using the internet.

6. Forget videos.
If you have slow internet speeds or a very old processor, it can take up to half an hour to load one to two-minute video. Unless you can leave your computer alone for hours to let it load, just forget about it. You can live without online videos!
