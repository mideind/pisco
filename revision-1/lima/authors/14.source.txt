In my room, I regularly have clothes that are clean enough not to go in the laundry, but not enough to go back in the wardrobe/closet. For example, a pair of jeans I wore yesterday, or a hoodie I slept in in the last few days. I currently put such clothes on a chair, but it usually just ends up as a pile of clothes.

I am looking for a better alternative for keeping these clothes easily accessible, preferably one that looks less messy and occupies less space than a chair.

To keep your clothes easily accessible and less messy, one option is getting an IVAR side panel from IKEA.
Lean it against a wall at a slight angle and put these “limbo” clothes over the horizontal bars.
It comes in different sizes, and stands almost entirely flat against the wall if you don't use it. If you want it hidden, it usually fits behind a door pretty well.
In addition, it will also look rather unique compared to most people’s clothes-chair solution.
