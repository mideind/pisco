How can you tell if someone is being truthful or lying to you?

To tell if someone if being truthful or lying to you, here are a few things to look for:
* Look for inconsistencies in what they say. If one time they said one thing, and another time they said the opposite, or if they contradict themselves within the same conversation, that's a sign that they may be lying.
* Look for signs of stress. Liars often have a harder time lying when they're under more stress. Pay attention to whether or not they seem nervous. Are they fidgeting? Stuttering? Avoiding eye contact? These can all be signs that they're lying to you. However, some people are good liars, and can lie with a straight face. This is why it's best to look for multiple signs that they're lying.
* Pay attention to what they don't say. If someone is lying to you, they may leave out details, or fail to correct you when you make an assumption that isn't true.
* Ask follow-up questions. Liars often give short answers because they're trying to avoid giving details that may incriminate them. Follow up with questions like, "Why did you do that?" or "How did that happen?" to see if they're fumbling for an answer.
* Ask questions you already know the answer to. This is a great way to catch someone in a lie. If you know the answer, you can say, "Oh, so it was you who broke the vase, not Kyle," and see if they correct you.
* Look for micro-expressions. A micro-expression is a brief, involuntary facial expression that reveals someone's true emotions. People who are lying may make a micro-expression of anxiety or guilt. You have to pay close attention, because these expressions only last for a fraction of a second.
* Pay attention if they change the subject. This is a classic sign of a liar. If someone is trying to distract you from the truth, they may change the subject or try to redirect the conversation.
And remember, people lie for many reasons. The simple fact that someone is lying to you does not mean that they are guilty of the crime you are investigating. They may be protecting someone else, or themselves from something embarrassing, or they may be lying about something completely unrelated. Always keep the reason for your questioning in mind, and be prepared to pursue other lines of inquiry based on the information you learn.
