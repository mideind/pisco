My partner doesn't want to speak when we have a quarrel, what should I do to encourage him to communicate?

Here are some suggestions for your circumstance where your partner is reluctant to talk when you have a quarrel.

First, ask yourself why you want your partner to talk when they don't want to. It is natural and healthy for people to need different amounts of time and space to process their emotions. If your partner is the type who needs a lot of time and space, pushing them to talk before they're ready will simply prolong the quarrel. You may very well be sabotaging yourself here.

Second, remember that you are not a mind-reader. You may think your partner is refusing to talk to you as a form of punishment, or to gain leverage in the argument, or any number of other reasons. But the only way to know why they are doing it is to ask them. You may not get a satisfying answer, but anything you learn will be better than the guesses you are making now.

Third, if you are certain that your partner is simply trying to &quot;win&quot; the argument by refusing to engage, you have two options: you can withdraw from the argument, or you can engage anyway. If you withdraw, you may be giving up on something you want, but you also avoid the conflict escalating further. If you engage anyway, you may be able to convince your partner (or yourself) that you are serious about the issue at hand, and that it is worth discussing. But you may also be pouring gasoline on a fire. Be careful here.
