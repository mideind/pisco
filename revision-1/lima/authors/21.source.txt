I have a 7yo son. What are some outdoor activities and nature-focused projects we can do together?

Here are some outdoor activities and nature-focused projects you could try to do together, some of which require little or no preparation:

* Go on nature walks and look for different kinds of trees, leaves, and flowers. Look for different types of rocks and pick up interesting ones to look at closely. Take a bag to put interesting things in.
* Go to a park and play on the swings, slide, and other equipment. Look for interesting trees, plants, and rocks.
* Go to a local farm and see what's growing. Check out the animals if they have any (chickens, goats, pigs, horses, etc.).
* Go geocaching with a handheld GPS. It's a high-tech version of a treasure hunt. You can find caches all over the place.
* Go hiking. Find a local trail and go for a walk.
* Play in a stream or pond. Look for different types of rocks and minerals. Look for fish and other critters.
* Build a fort in the woods. Use sticks and leaves to decorate it.
* Go rock climbing at a local climbing gym. Find a bouldering area if they have one. It's a fun way to climb without the risk of falling very far.
* Have a picnic lunch in the woods.
