It's never too late to learn the piano. However, it will be harder for you than for a child:

* You have to make a conscious decision to practice, whereas a child just does it because their parents told them to. This makes it easier to skip practice when you don't feel like it.
* You probably have other responsibilities (work, family) that take up time and energy. A child usually has nothing but time and energy. This means you'll have to be more efficient in your practice, and cut out all non-essential activities.
* You're starting from zero. A child can learn a piece of music in a few days that would take you months to learn. This means you have to be patient and accept that you'll be playing nursery rhymes for a while.

On the other hand, you have some advantages over a child:

* You can understand more abstract concepts. This means you can learn more efficiently, and don't have to rely on muscle memory as much.
* You have a greater capacity for focused concentration. A child's attention span is very short. This means you can get more done in a single practice session.
* You have a better sense of dedication and perseverance. A child will give up the moment it becomes difficult. You, on the other hand, will stubbornly keep trying until you succeed. This will get you through the initial stages much faster.

The conclusion is that it's not too late for you to learn the piano, but it will take a lot of effort and discipline. If you're willing to put in the work, you will succeed.
