What are the main differences between Xbox and PlayStation?
<|system|>
Both Xbox and PlayStation are leading gaming consoles, accounting together for the vast majority of the console market. Some notable differences between the two include:

* Manufacturer: Xbox is developed by Microsoft, while PlayStation is developed by Sony.
* Games: Both consoles feature a wide selection of games, with some titles distributed exclusively for PlayStation (e.g. God of War) or Xbox (e.g. Halo). PlayStation typically has more exclusive games.
* Controller: PlayStation has an almost symmetric controller, while the Xbox controller has an offset analog stick, which is more suitable for adult hands.

Additional differences include console design, online services, and VR support. Ultimately, selecting a gaming console depends on your personal preferences.
