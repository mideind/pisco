Andy Weir has written some best-selling books in science fiction. Here is a list of Weir's three most critically-acclaimed works, including a short description and explanation for why you might want to read them:

The Martian
Description: An American astronaut, Mark Watney, becomes stranded alone on Mars in 2035, and must improvise in order to survive.
Why Read: The Martian features technical details worthy of a hard sci-fi novel with comical writing and a healthy amount of suspense. It won the Hugo Award and was adapted into a blockbuster movie.

Artemis

Why Read: The novel combines the thrill of a heist with the right amount of scientific geekery associated with living on the moon. It won the Dragon Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

Project Hail Mary
Description: Set in the near future, Project Hail Mary centers on middle school teacher-turned-astronaut Ryland Grace, who wakes up from a coma afflicted with amnesia. He gradually remembers that he was sent to the Tau Ceti solar system, 12 light-years from Earth, to find a means of reversing a solar dimming event that could cause the extinction of humanity.
Why Read: Project Hail Mary is a science fiction masterpiece. It won the Hugo Award and is being adapted into a movie.
