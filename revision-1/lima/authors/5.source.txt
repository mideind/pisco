What if you could spend your life never sleeping? What would you do with the extra hours in each day?
<|system|>
If I could spend my life never sleeping, some of the things I might do with that extra time include:

* Spend more time with friends and family. I can use the extra time to develop stronger ties and bonds with my loved ones, including my family members and close friends. I might watch films more often with them or host games at night that we can play together. Or, I might organize more potluck parties where each one bring a dish. 
* Enjoy my favorite hobbies more (or discover new ones). I could use the extra time to take dance and music lessons, read more fiction books, collect action figures, etc. In addition, I would love to develop some new hobbies that I have always wanted to try, e.g. skiing and bouldering. 
* Travel and see more of the world. If I had lots of extra time, I would use them to travel around the world to experience life in different ways. I could explore new places, cultures, cuisines, traditions, and ways of living. I can also make friends with people from different backgrounds.
* Exercise and improve my physical condition. With more extra time, I would become more active and commit to a healtier lifestyle. For example, I'll stick to a regular fitness plan and increase my physical activity by adding strength training and taking a Yogo class.
* Work more to advance my career and personal growth. I might use the extra time to learn new skills outside of my primary career. For example, I would learn a new language or pursue a part-time job in art history or education. Moreover, I would get out of my comfort zone and become more proactive in buidling my network. 
* Get more involved in my community. With all of the extra time available to me, I could devote myself to volunteering or giving back to my local community. This might involve working with organizations like soup kitchens, animal shelters, or environmental conservation groups. Alternatively, I might consider starting my own nonprofit organization focused on addressing issues that matter most to me.
