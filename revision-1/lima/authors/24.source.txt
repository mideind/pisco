Opponents who argue that the death penalty is not needed as retribution argue that reformative justice is more productive, that innocent people are often killed in the search for retribution, and that “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.” Proponents who argue that the death penalty is a moral punishment state that “an eye for an eye” is justified to promote a good and just society that shuns evil. Opponents who argue that the death penalty is an immoral punishment state that humans should not kill other humans, no matter the reasons, because killing is killing.
