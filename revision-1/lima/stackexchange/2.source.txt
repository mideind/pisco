My USB drive used to be originally 8GB when I bought it.
I'm trying to reformatted in Windows 7 by right clicking on the drive and selecting ```Format...```. But the capacity only shows 250MB.
Is there something I can do to get the original size back? Maybe it got partitioned in a weird way? 
The  flash drive is a SanDisk Cruzer Micro 8GB.

The command line procedure is not simple, but it is the most likely thing to work. 
When re-formatting the "drive" you're actually only formatting a partition on the drive. You need to use the diskpart utility to remove the partitions and create 1 single partition covering the full volume.
```diskpart``` can be a bit dangerous, because if you pick the wrong disk or partition, you can remove data or partitions that are extremely, EXTREMELY important and lose all data on your machine. 
Proceed with extreme caution!
Open up a command prompt as administrator (open the start menu, type ```cmd``` and press Enter.)
Type ```diskpart``` and press Enter. You'll end up with a new prompt that looks like this:
```DISKPART>
```
Type
```list disk 
```
and you'll get a listing of all drives on your machine. 
Type
```select disk # 
```
to select a disk, where ```#``` is the number of the disk Windows screw-balled. Usually, the device is disk 1, but it's always best to make sure.
Then type
```list partition 
```
to get a listing of all partitions on the disk.
If you're sure you have the right disk/partition, you can then repeat typing
```select partition # 
delete partition 
```
until all partitions are removed from that drive (you may need to type ```delete partition override``` for protected partitions).
Once the drive is empty, exit diskpart and remove the drive. Wait at least 5 minutes, then re-insert the drive. DO NOT CLICK FORMAT â€“ this will most likely re-create the problem. Instead, enter diskpart again, and select the disk. Then type
```create partition primary 
```
Once you have created the partition, exit ```diskpart``` and, in the command promt, type 
```diskmgmt.msc 
```
This will provide a reliable way to create a FAT32 partition. On the drive you would like to format (NEVER TOUCH DISK 0!), right click and select ```format```. The ```allocation unit size``` option should be default, and the ```File System``` option should be set to ```FAT32```. The format may take a while, depending on the disk size, be patient.
This should fix partition troubles on any readable USB flash drive.
