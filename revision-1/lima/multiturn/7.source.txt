Here is an overview of both games, however, the ultimate decision concerning which game to select rests in your hands, as it hinges upon your personal preferences and interests.

1. Honor of Kings, developed by Tencent, reigns as a highly popular mobile game. This multiplayer online battle arena game brims with action and encompasses extensive social features. Notably, it showcases characters derived from Chinese Mythology, enabling players to construct their teams composed of these mythical personas.

2. On the other hand, Genshin Impact, crafted by miHoYo, takes the form of an action role-playing game available on both mobile and PC platforms. Distinguished by its captivating open-world setting, the game invites players into an immersive realm. It boasts a distinctive elemental combat system and has amassed considerable popularity, nurturing a substantial following of avid enthusiasts.

Based on the information above, if you prefer a multiplayer game with Chinese mythology characters, then Honor of Kings might be a good choice for you. If you're more interested in a single-player game set in an immersive open-world environment, then Genshin Impact might be the better option. Ultimately, it's up to your personal preferences and interests.
