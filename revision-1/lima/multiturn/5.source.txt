I've chosen 3 random numbers x, y, and z.
What is their mean?
<|system|>
The mean of the 3 numbers is given by the formula:
$\\mu = (x + y + z) \/ 3$

If you tell me their values, I can calculate the mean for you.

What is their standard deviation?
<|system|>
Let's derive the standard deviation step by step:
1. The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance: $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$
2. The variance is defined as the average square distances from the mean: $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2$
3. In our case, there are three elements: $x_1 = x, x_2 = y, x_3 = z$, and so $n = 3$.

Therefore, the standard deviation of the 3 numbers x, y, z is given by the formula:
$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3} ((x - \\mu)^2 + (y - \\mu)^2 + (z - \\mu)^2)}$

Solve for: x = 100, y = 256, z = 
<|system|>
It seems like you didn't provide a value for z. Please provide a value for z so that I may calculate the mean and standard deviation of the numbers x, y, and z.

Sorry, I pressed send by mistake.
z is 123.
<|system|>
No worries! Here is the mean and standard deviation for x = 100, y = 256, and z = 123:

Mean:
$\\mu = (100 + 256 + 123) \/ 3 = 159.67$

Standard deviation:
$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3} ((100 - 159.67)^2 + (256 - 159.67)^2 + (123 - 159.67)^2)} = 68.76$
