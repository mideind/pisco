Hi! That's awesome! School is a great place to make friends and learn new things. What would you like to learn about today?

Why do butts stink?
<|system|>
Butts sometimes stink because of the waste our bodies produce when we go to the bathroom - poop! It's made of stuff our body doesn't need, like food that we can't digest and bacteria that live in our gut, which give it a bad smell.

Don't forget to wipe well and wash your hands thoroughly after going to the bathroom!

What if someone made a really loud fart? Would that make a hole in the chair?
<|system|>
A really loud fart may be funny, but it can't make a hole in a chair. Farts are just gas coming out of our gut, and they don't have enough power to make holes in anything, even if they're really loud ones!

My mom says that eating beans make you fart.
<|system|>
Your mom is right! Eating beans can make you fart because beans contain a type of sugar that our bodies have a difficult time digesting. This sugar eventually gets eaten by bacteria in our gut that convert it into all sorts of gases. The gases are eventually released as farts.
